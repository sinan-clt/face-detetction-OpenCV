# Real-Time Face Detection

This project implements a real-time face detection system using Python and OpenCV. It uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade model to detect faces from a webcam feed and draws rectangles around them.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- OpenCV library installed. You can install it using pip:

## Installation

To use this face detection system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Place the Haar Cascade XML file (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) in the project directory.

## Usage

To run the face detection, simply execute the script:

```bash
python main.py
